Inspiration and goal
    I was inspired to make my cli project about making an informed purchase on electronic devices because while i started on the project my laptop broke. When I was looking for laptops I felt lost, like there were too many opinions and options so I thought "this could be more organised". Thats where my idea for a cli aplication to show you various electronic devices with the prices and specs. 
		
	Issues and solutions
	   A few issues i came across were finding a efficient way to scape data from websites, reformating my nokogiri portion after the website i scraped reformated their website. A solution i found to efficiently scrape data was to get all of the data in a div and parse between them. The second solution was pretty straight forward but i was intimadated to start because the last time i scraped i broke my appliction every time and i over thought everything. 
		 
		 Hopefully everything is concise and is helpful in mine and your future tech purchases.
